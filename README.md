# swgen
A powerful static website generator for Linux

## Quick start

    build.sh
    build.sh --watch

The `--watch` option requires `inotifywait` to be installed:

    sudo apt-get install inotify-tools

## Disclaimer

I like using a small knife to cut apples, a saw to cut wood, and a nail clipper to cut nails.
This tool is a very basic generator that fulfills my current needs, no more no less. It is however built upon proven tools computers have been running on for decades. If it can be useful to anybody, please help yourself.
